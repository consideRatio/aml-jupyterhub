Following the instructions in [README](https://github.com/informatics-lab/aml-jupyterhub/tree/master/README.md), copy the file `env.template` to `.env` and fill in the variables:
 * TENANT_ID - this can be found in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) if you search for and click on "Azure Active Directory", there will be a panel named "Tenant information", with "Tenant ID" in.
 * SUBSCRIPTION_ID - in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) you can click on "Subscriptions", and find the ID (the long hex string) for the one you want.
 * STORAGE_ACCOUNT_CONN_STR - this is relevant for mounting a users "home workspace".  If this functionality is desired, there needs to be an Azure Storage Account associated with it, and in the blade for the storage account in the Azure portal, you can click on "Access keys" on the left sidebar, and take the "Connection string" from either "key1" or "key2".
* SAS_TOKEN - this is a temporary access token for the above storage account - will soon be generated by the spawner code rather than input here.
* SSH_PUB_KEY, SSH_PRIVATE_KEY - again, these are used when mounting a user's home workspace.  You can generate a new key pair using the command `ssh-keygen` then following the on-screen prompts.  The public key will be the one with `.pub` at the end of the filename - enter the contents of this file into the SSH_PUB_KEY variable.  The private key corresponding to this will be the file without `.pub` - base64-encode the contents of this and put the result as the SSH_PRIVATE_KEY variable.
* LOCATION - the Azure region where the resources are located, e.g. "uksouth", or "westeurope".
* SPAWN_TO_WORK_SPACE - the name of an AML Workspace (will be created if it doesn't already exist).
* SPAWN_TO_COMPUTE_INSTANCE_SUFFIX - suffix will be appended to the name of the Compute Instance that is created.
* DEFAULT_USERNAME - not sure where this is used...
* RESOURCE_GROUP - the name of the Azure Resource Group containing the resources used here.  Can be created or found in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) - search for "Resource Groups"
* AAD_TENANT_ID - this will be the same as TENANT_ID above (we should probably deduplicate).
* AAD_CLIENT_ID, AAD_CLIENT_SECRET - these are used when using the Azure Active Directory OAuth authentication to log the user into Jupyterhub.  For this to work, the jupyterhub spawner needs to be registered as an Application in the Azure Portal (go to "Azure Active Directory", then "App Registration", and fill in the fields to register the app.  The "Client id" will then be on the overview panel for the app.  To generate a "Client secret", click on "Certificates and secrets" on the left sidebar, and click "+ New client secret".
